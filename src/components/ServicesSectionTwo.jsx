          We believe you can’t treat the whole person in 15 minutes. That is why our first visits
          are 60 minutes long. We give you the time to share your full health history, symptoms and
          goals, and to finally be heard.

          You deserve a team trained in women's health. You don’t need more referrals. You need a
          team of primary care providers specially trained in women’s health, who connect the dots
          between menopause, mental health, and healthy aging.
